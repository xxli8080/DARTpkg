The `DART` package accompanies the paper "DART: distance assisted recursive testing" (arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11085). It is designed to conduct powerful multiple testing under the assumption that hypotheses lie in a metric space with a known distance matrix, which partially informs the co-null/co-alternative status.

```{r setup}
library(DART)
```
Here, we show how to apply `DART` based on the P-values and distance matrix.
\par
The sample data we used is from a microbiome study with $n=456$ samples and $m=857$  amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Each ASV can be viewed as a testing unit and links to a hypothesis. Based on preprocessing process, we can get the distance matrix among the $m=857$ ASVs (`Dist0`) and a vector of p-values links to each hypothesis (`pvals`). Please refer to the paper for the in-depth information (e.g. data preprocess, hypotheses set up, tuning parameter selection, etc.) about the data analysis.

```{r}
# Setting up tuning parameters. Please refer to the paper for detailed tuning parameter selection procedure.
n <- 456
m <- 857
grids <- c(16)/sqrt(n*log(m)*log(log(m)))
Mgroup <- 3

# Stage 1: build aggregation tree
Atree <- A.tree.mult(grids=grids,Mgroup = Mgroup, Dist0 = Dist0)
# Stage 2: Embed multiple testing in the aggregation tree
Test.result <- test.mult(alpha=0.05,Llist=Atree$Llist,Dist0=Dist0,T1=t(qnorm(pvals,lower.tail=FALSE)))
